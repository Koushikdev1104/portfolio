											<h2>Experience</h2>
										</header>
										<h3>1. Cloud Intern at Wipro</h3>
										<p>During my tenure as a Cloud Intern at Wipro in Hyderabad (12/2021 to 06/2022), I gained hands-on experience with AWS, implementing foundational projects like EC2 instances, S3 storage, and IAM policies. I optimized cloud environments for scalability and cost efficiency, collaborating with cross-functional teams. A key achievement was designing a cloud-based inventory management system using AWS services (EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda) and automating updates with serverless functions, resulting in a 30% increase in tracking accuracy and a 40% reduction in manual effort. This project improved system scalability by 50% and implemented cost-saving measures through efficient resource utilization and automated scaling.</p>
										<h3>2. Subject Matter Expert at Chegg</h3>
										<p>As a Subject Matter Expert at Chegg IND in Hyderabad since November 2021, I enhance students' return on investment in education by helping them learn more efficiently and affordably. I contribute to Chegg.org, the impact, advocacy, and research arm of Chegg, which addresses student issues and provides valuable insights. My role involves creating high-quality educational content and offering academic support to improve student outcomes. I also engage in initiatives that make education more accessible and impactful. Through these efforts, I aim to support students in achieving their academic and career goals more effectively.</p>

										<h3>1. Automated Cloud Infrastructure Deployment</h3>
										<p> I automated the provisioning and management of cloud infrastructure using Terraform. This involved creating reusable Terraform code for setting up essential cloud resources, including Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), EC2 instances, and S3 buckets on AWS. By implementing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) best practices, I ensured that deployments were consistent, repeatable, and scalable. This approach streamlined the infrastructure management process, reduced manual intervention, and minimized the risk of errors, enhancing overall operational efficiency.

										<h3>2. Serverless Data Processing Pipeline</h3>
										<p>I developed a robust architecture to handle real-time data processing using AWS serverless technologies. The pipeline utilized AWS Kinesis Data Streams to ingest streaming data, which was then processed by AWS Lambda functions. The processed data was stored in S3 for further analysis. I created detailed diagrams to illustrate the data flow and serverless architecture, including triggers and processing steps. Screenshots of Lambda function code demonstrated the automation of data processing tasks, while CloudWatch dashboards provided insights into the performance and health of the Lambda functions and overall data pipeline. This serverless solution streamlined data handling, reduced infrastructure management overhead, and offered scalable and cost-effective processing capabilities</p>

										<h3>3. Multi-Region Web Application Deployment</h3>
										<p> I designed and implemented a highly available web application architecture across multiple AWS regions to ensure optimal performance and fault tolerance. The deployment strategy included a comprehensive Multi-Region Architecture Diagram showcasing the integration of AWS CloudFront for global content delivery, Route 53 for DNS-based traffic routing, and Elastic Load Balancers (ELB) to distribute traffic among EC2 instances in various regions. I developed a Content Delivery Flow diagram to illustrate how CloudFront accelerates content delivery and how Route 53 manages traffic efficiently. Additionally, a Load Balancing Diagram detailed the traffic distribution across multiple EC2 instances, while a Failover and Disaster Recovery Plan flowchart outlined mechanisms for regional failover and disaster recovery, ensuring continuous availability and minimal disruption in case of outages.</p>
